## üë∑ Get Started (Development)

_For frontend devs to start the backend and backend devs to start the frontend_

### Frontend

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
2. Clone this repository
3. Go to `src/web`
4. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
5. Run `npm run dev` to run the vite dev server for the frontend. Alternatively you can `npm run build` to build it and host it with the backend.

### Backend

‚ÑπÔ∏è If you want to see the front end hosted by the backend you need to run the steps for the frontend above first

1. Install the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) programming language toolchain
2. Switch to Rust nightly version with

   ```
   rustup default nightly
   rustup update
   ```

3. Install [Docker](https://docker.com)
4. Clone this repository
5. From the repository go to the `deployments` directory
6. Run `docker compose up -d`. Then you're ready to run the API
7. You find the API in `src/api` and can start it from there with `cargo run`

  applicable.
- **Styled:** Your code's style should match the existing and surrounding code
  style.
- **Simple:** Your code should accomplish its task as simply and
  idiomatically as possible.
- **Tested:** You must write (and pass) convincing tests for any new
  functionality.
- **Focused:** Your code should do what it's supposed to and nothing more.
